# SHARE IT Act Cost Savings Estimation

Scripts for estimating time and cost savings from OSPO proposed implementation of the SHARE IT Act

## About the Project

The CMS OSPO has created automated metadata generation processes and tooling for the agency's 10,000+ repositories that we estimate can reduce processing time from 1 hour (minimum) to ~10 minutes per repository. 

## Core Team

A list of core team members responsible for the code and documentation in this repository can be found in [COMMUNITY.md](COMMUNITY.md).

### METHODOLOGY 
```python
# Input variables for metadata automation
total_repositories = 10000
automated_percentage = 0.80
manual_time_minutes = 60  # Original manual time per repo
automated_time_minutes = 2  # Average automated processing time
manual_portion_time_minutes = 10  # Time for manual portion after automation
hourly_rate = 80  # GS-13/14 fully-loaded $100-150/hour. Contractor rates range $125-200/hour.


years_to_project = [1, 5, 10]

# Input variables for hypothetical code reuse
avg_project_cost = 1000000  # $1M per project
num_projects = 100          # Number of new projects per year
reuse_rates = [0.01, 0.05, 0.10]
efficiency_factor = 0.8     # Adjustment for reuse implementation effort

# Input variables for actual code reuse
annual_it_spend = 2800000000  # $2.8B annual IT spending
development_budget = 700000000  # $700M development budget (25%)
reuse_rates = [0.01, 0.05, 0.10]
efficiency_factor = 0.8

```


## ESTIMATED IMPACT
### DISCLAIMER
These rough estimates are for *prospective* work that we expect will need to be done in the future, and do not represent a reduction in current work that is already happening, or a reduction in money that is already being spent.


#### Estimated Metadata Automation Savings
- 94% reduction in processing time
- 9,400 hours saved annually
- $752K saved in year one
- $7.52M saved over 10 years

| Period | Time Saved (Hours) | Cost Savings |
|--------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1 Year | 9,400 | $752,000 |
| 5 Years | 47,000 | $3.76M |
| 10 Years | 94,000 | $7.52M |

#### Hypothetical Code Reuse Potential Savings: `generate_savings_reuse_analysis.py`
- Average Project Cost: $1,000,000
- Number of New Projects per year: 100
- Reuse Implementation Effort: 80%
- Estimate of Annual IT Spend: $100,000,000

| Reuse Rate |  Cost Savings |
|------------|---------------|
| 1% reuse   | $800,000  |
| 5% reuse   | $4,000,000 |
| 10% reuse  | $8,000,000  |
| 25% reuse  | $20,000,000 |
| 50% reuse  | $40,000,000 |

#### Code Reuse Potential Savings: `generate_savings_reuse_analysis_real.py`

Based on publicly available information, CMS's annual IT spending is approximately $2.8 billion (FY2023). This includes both internal systems and contractor-operated systems.


Breaking this down further:
- Major IT investments: ~$2.3 billion
- Operations and maintenance: ~$2.1 billion
- Development, modernization, and enhancement: ~$700 million

Based on the reported $700,000,000 DME budget:

| Reuse Rate |  Cost Savings |
|------------|---------------|
| 1% reuse   | $5,600,000  |
| 5% reuse   | $28,000,000 |
| 10% reuse  | $56,000,000  |
| 25% reuse  | $140,000,000 |
| 50% reuse  | $280,000,000 |
